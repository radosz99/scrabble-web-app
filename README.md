# General info

Multiplayer scrabble game.

On the start page (*/*) select number of players and go to the main view (*/game/view*). 
It is possible to join a 'computer' based on the algorithm from *lab07* to the game and save the current state to the *.txt* file - the board, users and their points and who has the queue.

Words are inserted in the form:
```
(coordinate X of letter1):(coordinate Y of letter1):(letter1);(coordinate X of letter2):(coordinate Y of letter2):(letter2);...
```

For example:
```
5:6:A;5:7:B;5:8:C;5:9:D;5:10:E
```
The correctness of moves has not been implemented yet (but of course the computer does it correctly).

- [x] Saving to file
- [x] Playing with computer
- [x] Move evaluating
- [ ] Loading game state from file
- [ ] Verify correctness of moves
